# Comet-String
Another C++ String Class

Initially created for fun, now being used, and semi-tailored for, my Comet Editor project.

Comet String is relatively small but has many of the features you would expect in a string class.

#Current Features
<ul>
  <li>return a substring</li> 
  <li>append</li> 
  <li>insert</li> 
  <li>capitalize and lowercase individual characters, substrings, or the entire string</li>
  <li>replace a character at an index or replace an entire substring</li>
  <li>Delete an index or substring </li>
  <li>Get string as a cstring</li>
  <li>And more, with more features being added!</li>
 </ul>
 
 #Updates
 This project is updated sporadically; mostly when I encounter a bug or need a new feature in Comet Editor.
  
  #Usage
  This project, as is the case with all of my projects, is hosted mostly for my own convenience, but also with the hope that
  at least one person may find it useful/educational. If, for whatever reason, you are that person, feel free to copy, hack and modify
  this as you see fit!
